            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there — I'm Thomas Denton, a true explorer at heart. I'm someone who finds joy in almost everything this world has to offer — from the rhythm of music to the logic of code, the artistry of film to the precision of medical work, the beauty of nature to the complexity of robotics. I don’t just wear many hats — I build them, code them, sketch them, and probably write a poem about them too.

I’m a lifelong learner and a hands-on creator. Whether I’m developing software, producing a short film, sketching digital art, building a mod, crafting with wood, hiking a trail, or diving into a medical textbook — I dive in with curiosity and passion. My hobbies aren’t just pastimes; they’re ways I connect with the world, challenge myself, and create meaning.

Technology, art, science, sports, literature, nature — I live in the in-between. I believe there's strength in being a generalist with specialist mindsets, blending disciplines to come up with creative solutions and innovative ideas.

When I’m not building something, I’m probably out hiking, dancing under the stars, jamming to music, solving puzzles, casting a fishing line, or sharing ideas with new friends. At the core of it all, I’m just a human fueled by wonder, driven by creativity, and always ready for the next adventure.</p>

                    <p>I created this SFTP Server out of the thought of running out of storage space on all my cloud storage services and drivers.</p>
                    <p>Technologies used: Node.js, Express, FTP</p>

                    <title>Music Creations</title>
                    <p>I created this music creation repository to showcase some of the music I have made over the years. It's a responsive personal website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my music creations and blog about my learning journey. It's a current work in progress but It's mostly complete.</p>
