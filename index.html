            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate developer with experience in building modern, responsive websites and applications. I enjoy solving problems and learning new technologies, and I am always looking for new challenges to tackle as well as an opportunity to collaborate with others while doing art and gaming.</p>

                    <title>SFTP Server</title>
                    <p>I created this SFTP Server out of the thought of running out of storage space on all my cloud storage services and drivers.</p>
                    <p>Technologies used: Node.js, Express, FTP</p>

                    <title>Music Creations</title>
                    <p>I created this music creation repository to showcase some of the music I have made over the years. It's a responsive personal website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my music creations and blog about my learning journey. It's a current work in progress but It's mostly complete.</p>
                    <p>Technologies used: StarMaker, Voloco, Various Music Recording Software</p>
